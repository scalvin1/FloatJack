	Floating point arithmetic for the Hack Computer.

	Contents:
	Float.jack      Floating point class for Jack.
	FloatTest.jack  Extensive test suite for Float class.  The test suite is
        	        too big to compile to a .hack file; it can only be run
			in the VM Emulator.
	Main.jack       Test driver and example code
	Float.hack      Example code compiled without test suite and translated
        	        with my optimizing VM translator.  Can be run in the CPU
                	Emulator.

	See documentation in Float.jack for usage and implementation details.
